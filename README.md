# Welcome to the Algorithm Code

The majority of this code is a fork from [Matterport's RCNN project](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)

In this code, there is single-use and multi-use classification (which is built off the existing model) of food items and more features that are directly applicable to this project.

The majority of the implemented code can be found in samples/coco/. test.py and visualize2.py is where major changes were made to the code.
